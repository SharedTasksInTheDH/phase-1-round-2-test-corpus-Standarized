Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; (when she thought it&#10;over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it&#10;all seemed quite natural;) but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,&#10;and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind&#10;that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of&#10;it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see&#10;it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&#10;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to&#10;get out again.&#10;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so&#10;suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself&#10;falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.&#10;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went&#10;down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. [...] &quot;Well!&quot; thought Alice to&#10;herself, &quot;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave&#10;they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top&#10;of the house!&quot; (Which was very likely true.)&#10;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! &quot;I wonder how many miles I've fallen by&#10;this time'?&quot; she said aloud. &quot;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me&#10;see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—&quot; [...] &quot;—yes, that's about the right&#10;distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?&quot; (Alice had not the slightest&#10;idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)&#10;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &quot;Dinah'll miss&#10;me very much to-night, I should think!&quot; (Dinah was the cat.) &quot;I hope they'll remember her saucer&#10;of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the&#10;air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats&#10;eat bats, I wonder?&quot; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in&#10;a dreamy sort of way, &quot;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&quot; and sometimes, &quot;Do bats eat cats?&quot;&#10;for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.&#10;She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand&#10;with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, &quot;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever&#10;eat a bat?&quot; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and&#10;the fall was over.&#10;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was&#10;all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,&#10;hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just&#10;in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &quot;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!&quot;&#10;She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she&#10;found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.&#10;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the&#10;way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,&#10;wondering how she was ever to get out again.&#10;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on&#10;it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors&#10;of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any&#10;rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low&#10;curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high:&#10;she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&#10;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a&#10;rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How&#10;she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and&#10;those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &quot;and even if my&#10;head would go through,&quot; thought poor Alice, &quot;it would be of very little use without my shoulders.&#10;Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&quot;&#10;For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think&#10;that very few things indeed were really impossible.&#10;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half&#10;hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up&#10;like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (&quot;which certainly was not here&#10;before,&quot; said Alice,) and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words&#10;&quot;DRINK ME,&quot; beautifully printed on it in large letters.&#10;It was all very well to say &quot;Drink me,&quot; but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a&#10;hurry. &quot;No, I'll look first,&quot; she said, &quot;and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not;&quot; for she&#10;had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild&#10;beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their&#10;friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and&#10;that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never&#10;forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &quot;poison,&quot; it is almost certain to disagree&#10;with you, sooner or later.&#10;However, this bottle was not marked &quot;poison,&quot; so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very&#10;nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast&#10;turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.&#10;&#10;*⁠*⁠*⁠*&#10;*⁠*⁠*&#10;*⁠*⁠*⁠*&#10;&#10;&quot;What a curious feeling!&quot; said Alice; &quot;I must be shutting up like a telescope.&quot;&#10;[...]&#10;After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once;&#10;but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden&#10;key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she&#10;could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs&#10;of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor&#10;little thing sat down and cried.&#10;&quot;Come, there's no use in crying like that!&quot; said Alice to herself, rather sharply; &quot;I advise you&#10;to leave off this minute!&quot; She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom&#10;followed it,) and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and&#10;once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet&#10;she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two&#10;people. &quot;But it's no use now,&quot; thought poor Alice, &quot;to pretend to be two people! Why, there's&#10;hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!&quot;&#10;[...]&#10;In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and&#10;she looked up eagerly [...].&#10;&#10;IT was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as&#10;if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself, &quot;The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my&#10;dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where&#10;can I have dropped them, I wonder?&quot; [...]&#10;Very soon the rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry&#10;tone, &quot;Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of&#10;gloves and a fan! Quick, now!&quot; And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the&#10;direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake that it had made.&#10;&quot;He took me for his housemaid,&quot; she said to herself as she ran. &quot;How surprised he'll be when he&#10;finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.&quot; As&#10;she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate&#10;with the name &quot;W. RABBIT&quot; engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs,&#10;in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she&#10;had found the fan and gloves.&#10;&quot;How queer it seems,&quot; Alice said to herself, &quot;to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose&#10;Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!&quot; And she began fancying the sort of thing that would&#10;happen: &quot;'Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute,&#10;nurse! But I've got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see that the mouse&#10;doesn't get out.' Only I don't think,&quot; Alice went on, &quot;that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if&#10;it began ordering people about like that!&quot;&#10;By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it&#10;(as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and&#10;a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little&#10;bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words &quot;DRINK ME,&quot;&#10;but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. &quot;I know something interesting is sure to&#10;happen,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this&#10;bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a&#10;tiny little thing!&quot;&#10;It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle,&#10;she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being&#10;broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself, &quot;That's quite enough—I hope I shan't&#10;grow any more—As it is, I can't get out at the door—I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!&quot;&#10;Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel&#10;down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect&#10;of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she&#10;went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the&#10;chimney, and said to herself, &quot;Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?&quot;&#10;Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger:&#10;still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting&#10;out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.&#10;&quot;It was much pleasanter at home,&quot; thought poor Alice, &quot;when one wasn't always growing larger and&#10;smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that&#10;rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what&#10;can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never&#10;happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that&#10;there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one—but I'm grown up now,&quot; she added in a sorrowful&#10;tone, &quot;at least there's no room to grow up any more here.&quot;&#10;&quot;But then,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;shall I never get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one&#10;way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like&#10;that!&quot;&#10;&quot;Oh, you foolish Alice!&quot; she answered herself. &quot;How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's&#10;hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!&quot;&#10;And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of&#10;it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.&#10;&quot;Mary Ann! Mary Ann!&quot; said the voice, &quot;fetch me my gloves this moment!&quot; Then came a little&#10;pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she&#10;trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as&#10;large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.&#10;Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but as the door opened inwards,&#10;and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say&#10;to itself, &quot;Then I'll go round and get in at the window.&quot;&#10;&quot;That you won't!&quot; thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just&#10;under the window she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get&#10;hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from&#10;which she concluded that it was just possible, it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something&#10;of the sort.&#10;Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit's—&quot;Pat! Pat! Where are you?&quot; And then a voice she had never&#10;heard before, &quot;Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!&quot;&#10;&quot;Digging for apples, indeed!&quot; said the Rabbit angrily. &quot;Here! Come and help me out of this!&quot;&#10;(Sounds of more broken glass.)&#10;&quot;Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?&quot;&#10;&quot;Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!&quot; (He pronounced it &quot;arrum.&quot;)&#10;&quot;An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!&quot;&#10;&quot;Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.&quot;&#10;&quot;Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!&quot;&#10;[...] After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, &quot;A&#10;barrowful will do, to begin with.&quot;&#10;&quot;A barrowful of what?&quot; thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower&#10;of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. &quot;I'll put&#10;a stop to this,&quot; she said to herself, and shouted out, &quot;You'd better not do that again!&quot; which&#10;produced another dead silence.&#10;Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay&#10;on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. &quot;If I eat one of these cakes,&quot; she thought,&#10;&quot;it's sure to make some change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make&#10;me smaller, I suppose.&quot;&#10;So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.&#10;As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found&#10;quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in&#10;the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They&#10;all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon&#10;found herself safe in a thick wood.&#10;&quot;The first thing I've got to do,&quot; said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, &quot;is&#10;to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I&#10;think that will be the best plan.&quot;&#10;[...]&#10;Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.&#10;&quot;That's very curious!&quot; she thought. &quot;But everything's curious to-day. I think I may as well go in&#10;at once.&quot; And in she went.&#10;Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. &quot;Now, I'll&#10;manage better this time,&quot; she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and&#10;unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she&#10;had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the&#10;little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright&#10;flower-beds and the cool fountains.&#10;&#10;A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but&#10;there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious&#10;thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them&#10;say, &quot;Look out now. Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!&quot;&#10;&quot;I couldn't help it,&quot; said Five, in a sulky tone; &quot;Seven jogged my elbow.&quot;&#10;On which Seven looked up and said, &quot;That's right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!&quot;&#10;&quot;You'd better not talk!&quot; said Five. &quot;I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be&#10;beheaded!&quot;&#10;&quot;What for?&quot; said the one who had spoken first.&#10;&quot;That's none of your business, Two!&quot; said Seven.&#10;&quot;Yes, it is his business!&quot; said Five, &quot;and I'll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots&#10;instead of onions.&quot;&#10;Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun, &quot;Well, of all the unjust things—&quot; when his eye&#10;chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the&#10;others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.&#10;&quot;Would you tell me, please,&quot; said Alice, a little timidly, &quot;why you are painting those roses?&quot;&#10;Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, &quot;Why, the fact is, you&#10;see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;&#10;and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see,&#10;Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to—&quot; At this moment Five, who had been anxiously&#10;looking across the garden, called out &quot;The Queen! The Queen!&quot; and the three gardeners instantly&#10;threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked&#10;round, eager to see the Queen.&#10;[...] Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three&#10;gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; &quot;and&#10;besides, what would be the use of a procession,&quot; thought she, &quot;if people had all to lie down on&#10;their faces, so that they couldn't see it?&quot; So she stood where she was, and waited.&#10;When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen&#10;said severely, &quot;Who is this?&quot; She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in&#10;reply.&#10;&quot;Idiot!&quot; said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on,&#10;&quot;What's your name, child?&quot;&#10;&quot;My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,&quot; said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself,&#10;&quot;Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!&quot;&#10;[...] &quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; said the Queen, turning purple.&#10;&quot;I won't!&quot; said Alice.&#10;&quot;Off with her head!&quot; the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.&#10;&quot;Who cares for you?&quot; said Alice, [...] &quot;You're nothing but a pack of cards!&quot;&#10;At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her; she gave a little&#10;scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on&#10;the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves&#10;that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.&#10;&quot;Wake up, Alice dear!&quot; said her sister; &quot;why, what a long sleep you've had!&quot;&#10;&quot;Oh, I've had such a curious dream!&quot; said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could&#10;remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and&#10;when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, &quot;It was a curious dream, dear, certainly:&#10;but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.&quot; So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she&#10;ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.&#10;&#10;But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting&#10;sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming&#10;after a fashion, and this was her dream:—&#10;First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her&#10;knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her&#10;voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would&#10;always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around&#10;her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.&#10;[...]&#10;So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had&#10;but to open them again and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in&#10;the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to&#10;tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the&#10;sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she&#10;knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the&#10;distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.&#10;Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be&#10;herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving&#10;heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their&#10;eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of&#10;long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their&#10;simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.&#10;&#10;THE END.&#10;&#10;&#10;"/><cas:View sofa="72" members="1 12 15 20 25 30 35 40 47 54 63"/></xmi:XMI>
