rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me&#10;into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of&#10;men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the law-copyists or&#10;scriveners. [...] Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is&#10;ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my&#10;own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report&#10;which will appear in the sequel.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as copyists in my employment, &#10;and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Now my original business—that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite&#10;documents of all sorts—was considerably increased by receiving the master's office. There was now&#10;great work for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have&#10;additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my&#10;office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now—pallidly&#10;neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises into two parts,&#10;one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by myself. According to my humor I threw&#10;open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors,&#10;but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing&#10;was to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a&#10;window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but&#10;which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some&#10;light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between&#10;two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory&#10;arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from&#10;my sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were&#10;conjoined.&#10;&#10;At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to&#10;copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day&#10;and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with&#10;his application, had he been cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely,&#10;mechanically.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a&#10;week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery. It became necessary to examine&#10;them. It was an important suit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I&#10;called Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in the&#10;hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and&#10;Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to&#10;Bartleby to join this interesting group.&#10;&#10;“Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.”&#10;&#10;I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at&#10;the entrance of his hermitage.&#10;&#10;“What is wanted?” said he mildly.&#10;&#10;“The copies, the copies,” said I hurriedly. “We are going to examine them. There”—and I held&#10;towards him the fourth quadruplicate.&#10;&#10;“I would prefer not to,” he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.&#10;&#10;For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of my seated column of&#10;clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such&#10;extraordinary conduct.&#10;&#10;“Why do you refuse?”&#10;&#10;“I would prefer not to.”&#10;&#10;With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further&#10;words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But there was something about Bartleby that&#10;not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to&#10;reason with him.&#10;&#10;“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to you, because one&#10;examination will answer for your four papers. It is common usage. Every copyist is bound to help&#10;examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you not speak? Answer!”&#10;&#10;“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that while I had been&#10;addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully comprehended the&#10;meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some paramount&#10;consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.&#10;&#10;“You are decided, then, not to comply with my request—a request made according to common usage&#10;and common sense?”&#10;&#10;He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound. Yes: his decision was&#10;irreversible.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed&#10;fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, had a desk there; that&#10;he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was&#10;permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and&#10;Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was&#10;never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if&#10;entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not&#10;to—in other words, that he would refuse pointblank.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in&#10;densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman&#10;residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments.&#10;Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket.&#10;The fourth I knew not who had.&#10;&#10;Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and&#10;finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk around to my chambers for a&#10;while. Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by&#10;something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key&#10;was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the&#10;apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered&#10;dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, and—preferred&#10;not admitting me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better&#10;walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his&#10;affairs.&#10;&#10;Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday&#10;morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had&#10;such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as&#10;desired. [...]&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to&#10;the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be&#10;seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone.&#10;Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must&#10;have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The&#10;cushioned seat of a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining&#10;form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and&#10;brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of&#10;ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. [...]&#10;&#10;Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby's closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.&#10;&#10;I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the&#10;desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within. Every thing was&#10;methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the&#10;files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged&#10;it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a&#10;savings' bank.&#10;&#10;I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I remembered that he never&#10;spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had&#10;never seen him reading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking&#10;out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall [...]. And more&#10;than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid&#10;haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my&#10;tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest&#10;incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that&#10;behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.&#10;&#10;Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my&#10;office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving&#10;all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those&#10;of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew&#10;and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion.&#10;[...] &#10;&#10;The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery.&#10;Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.&#10;&#10;“Why, how now? what next?” exclaimed I, “do no more writing?”&#10;&#10;“No more.”&#10;&#10;“And what is the reason?”&#10;&#10;“Do you not see the reason for yourself,” he indifferently replied.&#10;&#10;I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed. Instantly it&#10;occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few&#10;weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision.&#10;&#10;I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. [...]&#10;&#10;Still added days went by. Whether Bartleby's eyes improved or not, I could not say. To all&#10;appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all&#10;events, he would do no copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had&#10;permanently given up copying.&#10;&#10;“What!” exclaimed I; “suppose your eyes should get entirely well—better than ever before—would&#10;you not copy then?”&#10;&#10;“I have given up copying,” he answered, and slid aside.&#10;&#10;[...] Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days' time he must&#10;unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring&#10;some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the&#10;first step towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added I, “I shall see&#10;that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember.”&#10;&#10;At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Bartleby was there.&#10;&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;“Bartleby,” said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, “I am seriously&#10;displeased. I am pained, Bartleby. I had thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a&#10;gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would suffice—in short, an&#10;assumption. But it appears I am deceived.” [...]&#10;&#10;He answered nothing.&#10;&#10;“Will you, or will you not, quit me?” I now demanded in a sudden passion, advancing close to him.&#10;&#10;“I would prefer not to quit you,” he replied, gently emphasizing the not.&#10;&#10;“What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you pay my taxes? Or is this&#10;property yours?”&#10;&#10;He answered nothing.&#10;&#10;“Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you copy a small paper for&#10;me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step round to the post-office? In a word, will&#10;you do any thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?”&#10;&#10;He silently retired into his hermitage.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having&#10;reference to the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. [...] I resolved to gather&#10;all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus.&#10;&#10;Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to&#10;Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the&#10;idea to his careful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to meditate upon it, he&#10;apprised me that his original determination remained the same; in short, that he still preferred&#10;to abide with me.&#10;&#10;[...] No more then. Since he will not quit me, I must quit&#10;him. I will change my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, that if I find&#10;him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common trespasser.&#10;&#10;Acting accordingly, next day I thus addressed him: “I find these chambers too far from the City&#10;Hall; the air is unwholesome. In a word, I propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no&#10;longer require your services. I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another place.”&#10;&#10;He made no reply, and nothing more was said.&#10;&#10;On the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers, and having but little&#10;furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing&#10;behind the screen, which I directed to be removed the last thing. It was withdrawn; and being&#10;folded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked room. &#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked, and started at every&#10;footfall in the passages. When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at&#10;the threshold for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key. But these fears were&#10;needless. Bartleby never came nigh me.&#10;&#10;I thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited me, inquiring whether I&#10;was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No.—Wall-street.&#10;&#10;Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.&#10;&#10;“Then sir,” said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, “you are responsible for the man you left&#10;there. He refuses to do any copying; he refuses to do any thing; he says he prefers not to; and&#10;he refuses to quit the premises.”&#10;&#10;“I am very sorry, sir,” said I, with assumed tranquility, but an inward tremor, “but, really, the&#10;man you allude to is nothing to me—he is no relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold&#10;me responsible for him.”&#10;&#10;“In mercy's name, who is he?”&#10;&#10;“I certainly cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. Formerly I employed him as a copyist;&#10;but he has done nothing for me now for some time past.”&#10;&#10;“I shall settle him then,—good morning, sir.”&#10;&#10;Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt a charitable prompting to&#10;call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld&#10;me.&#10;&#10;All is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through another week no further&#10;intelligence reached me. But coming to my room the day after, I found several persons waiting at&#10;my door in a high state of nervous excitement.&#10;&#10;“That's the man—here he comes,” cried the foremost one, whom I recognized as the lawyer who had&#10;previously called upon me alone.&#10;&#10;“You must take him away, sir, at once,” cried a portly person among them, advancing upon me, and&#10;whom I knew to be the landlord of No.—Wall-street. “These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it&#10;any longer; Mr. B—” pointing to the lawyer, “has turned him out of his room, and he now persists&#10;in haunting the building generally, sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping&#10;in the entry by night. Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some fears are&#10;entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without delay.”&#10;&#10;Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have locked myself in my new&#10;quarters. In vain I persisted that Bartleby was nothing to me—no more than to any one else. In&#10;vain:—I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the&#10;terrible account. Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one person present obscurely&#10;threatened) I considered the matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me a&#10;confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the lawyer's) own room, I would that afternoon&#10;strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.&#10;&#10;Going up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting upon the banister at the&#10;landing.&#10;&#10;“What are you doing here, Bartleby?” said I.&#10;&#10;“Sitting upon the banister,” he mildly replied.&#10;&#10;I motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;“Now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something, or something must be done&#10;to you. Now what sort of business would you like to engage in? Would you like to re-engage in&#10;copying for some one?”&#10;&#10;“No; I would prefer not to make any change.”&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;Despairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him, when a final thought occurred &#10;to me—one which had not been wholly unindulged before.&#10;&#10;“Bartleby,” said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, “will&#10;you go home with me now—not to my office, but my dwelling—and remain there till we can conclude&#10;upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now, right away.”&#10;&#10;“No: at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.”&#10;&#10;I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my&#10;flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street towards Broadway, and jumping into the first&#10;omnibus was soon removed from pursuit. [...] So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the &#10;incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surrendering my business to Nippers, for a &#10;few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed &#10;over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria. In fact &#10;I almost lived in my rockaway for the time.&#10;&#10;When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon the desk. I opened it with&#10;trembling hands. It informed me that the writer had sent to the police, and had Bartleby removed&#10;to the Tombs as a vagrant. Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he wished me&#10;to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the facts. These tidings had a&#10;conflicting effect upon me. At first I was indignant; but at last almost approved. The landlord's&#10;energetic, summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not think I would have&#10;decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the&#10;only plan.&#10;&#10;As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be conducted to the Tombs,&#10;offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his ways, they had&#10;permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and especially in the inclosed grass-platted&#10;yard thereof. And so I found him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face&#10;towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw&#10;peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.&#10;&#10;“Bartleby!”&#10;&#10;“I know you,” he said, without looking round,—“and I want nothing to say to you.”&#10;&#10;“It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,” said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion.&#10;“And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being&#10;here. And see, it is not so sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and here is&#10;the grass.”&#10;&#10;“I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I left him.&#10;&#10;[...]&#10;&#10;Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went through the corridors&#10;in quest of Bartleby; but without finding him.&#10;&#10;“I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,” said a turnkey, “may be he's gone to loiter in the&#10;yards.”&#10;&#10;So I went in that direction.&#10;&#10;“Are you looking for the silent man?” said another turnkey passing me. “Yonder he lies—sleeping&#10;in the yard there. 'Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down.”&#10;&#10;The yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The surrounding&#10;walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all sounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the&#10;masonry weighed upon me with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The heart of&#10;the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed,&#10;dropped by birds, had sprung.&#10;&#10;Strangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his side, his head&#10;touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted Bartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went&#10;close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed&#10;profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver&#10;ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.&#10;&#10;The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. “His dinner is ready. Won't he dine to-day,&#10;either? Or does he live without dining?”&#10;&#10;“Lives without dining,” said I, and closed his eyes.&#10;&#10;“Eh!—He's asleep, aint he?”&#10;&#10;“With kings and counselors,” murmured I.&#10;&#10;* * * * * * * *&#10;There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history. Imagination will readily&#10;supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby's interment. But ere parting with the reader, let me&#10;say, that if this little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who&#10;Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator's making his&#10;acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to&#10;gratify it. Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came&#10;to my ear a few months after the scrivener's decease. Upon what basis it rested, I could never&#10;ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not&#10;been without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with&#10;some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The report was this: that Bartleby had been a&#10;subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly&#10;removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately&#10;express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a&#10;man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to&#10;heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the&#10;flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the&#10;pale clerk takes a ring:—the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note&#10;sent in swiftest charity:—he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for&#10;those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died&#10;stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.&#10;&#10;Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!"/><cas:View sofa="40" members="1 12 15 20 25 30 35 291 63 298 79 305 86 312 319 93 326 100 333 107 340 347 361 354 368 375 382 114 389 121 396 128 403 135 410 142 417 149 424 156 431 163 438 170 445 177 452 184 459 191 466 198 473 205 480 212 487 219 494 226 501 233 508 240 247 515 254 522 261 268 70 275"/></xmi:XMI>
